# Akinator
This program can provide three game options: difference between two objects, find the definition of the object, guess the object. The main feature of the game is that it builds a tree by parsing a file that updates the library with each new game.<br/> 
It is worth noting that Akinator uses a stack due to the fact that in the process of searching for an element along the tree, a recursive descent occurs and it is necessary to give a definition in a different order.
